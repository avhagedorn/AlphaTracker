This project is incomplete, and likely very broken in many areas. However, I'm stepping back from this to focus on work. 

This was inspired by an interview I was preparing for at Old Mission Capital. I got the job.

---

Here's how to get this up and running. This might not work and this is primarily for my future reference.

```
git clone git@github.com:avhagedorn/AlphaTracker.git

cd ./backend

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r dev_requirements.txt

docker pull postgres
docker run --name alpha_tracker_db -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5432:5432 -d postgres && sleep 1 && alembic upgrade head

[in a separate terminal]
cd ./backend
uvicorn alpha_tracker.main:app --reload --port 8080

[in a separate terminal]
cd ./web
npm run dev
```

You can also use the VS Code "Run + Debug" scripts if you prefer.
